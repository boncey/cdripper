# CDRipper

## Java project that contains two command line programs.

One to rip a music CD, pulling music info from CDDB.

The other encodes the CD to a variety of formats (currently flac, mp3 and ogg). Encoding is done in parallel to speed things up.

All ripping and encoding is done by executing binaries:

### Linux

commands used: cdparanoia cdda2wav flac lame oggenc


### MacOS
Setting up the tools (assumes homebrew usage).

    brew update
    brew install cdrtools cdparanoia libcddb libcdio flac lame
